# Water Quality Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs an Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) on water quality datasets to assess various quality metrics, identify patterns, and understand key factors affecting water quality. The analysis utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical insights, helping inform water quality assessments and potential interventions.

## Project Structure
- **`water-quality-explanatory-data-analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing all analysis, visualizations, and insights for water quality data.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the water quality dataset, explore relationships among different quality parameters, and derive actionable insights that could support data-driven decision-making in water quality management.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handles loading and cleaning the dataset, filling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Examines statistical properties of the data, including mean, median, and distribution analysis of water quality indicators.
- **Visualization**: Creates various visualizations to understand trends and correlations between water quality metrics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzes correlations among water quality parameters to identify possible interdependencies.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and open `water-quality-explanatory-data-analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook. Run each cell in sequence to explore the data analysis steps. Each section is documented with comments explaining the process.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
jupyter notebook water-quality-explanatory-data-analysis.ipynb
```

## Results and Findings
Key findings from the analysis are noted within the notebook, offering insights into water quality trends, correlations, and factors affecting quality.
